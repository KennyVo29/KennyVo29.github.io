### Host Machines vs Virtual Machines vs Containers
I wanted to talk about the differences between a host machine, a container, virtual machines and what their characteristics are.

### Host Machines
A host machine is your standard PC (computer). It is comprised of many small physical components that work in conjunction to provide you with the necessary resources to compute. For something to be consider a computer, it must have a CPU, Memory, Storage. The CPU a central processing unit that is responsible for computing instructions. You can think of a CPU as the brains of machine or the chef of a kitchen. Memory is a hardware component responsible for giving the CPU the ability to compute instructions. You can think of Memory as the space available for a CPU to work, or in kitchen analogy, you can think of it as the counter space to which a chef is able to work. The more space on the table, the more the chef can utilize the space to cook. You can think of storage is the kitchen pantry. Like with a pantry that holds all the necessary ingredients to cook, storage holds all the necessary data to compute. 
### Virtual Machines
Virtual Machines are machines that use virtualization and or emulation to simulate a hardware system and can provide the same functionality as a real physical computer. Due to the increasing power of technology, virtual machines were created to utilize the strengths of newer and more powerful technology without having to create the bare metal hardware to support a single computer. In a virtual machine, there is the barebones hardware (i.e. logic board, CPU, memory, etc.) sits at the foundation of a machine. A hypervisor sits on top of the hardware, acting as a emulator, uses the hardware resources and can emulate multiple physical systems on one machine. It can compartmentalize each operating system and divvy up the resources according to each virtual machine needs. That means that physical computers resources is virtual divided according to each virtual machines specifications. Each machine will have its own operating system and all required files to run that operating system. Its literally its own virtual (physical) machines. The hypervisor is responsible for handling each machine and assuring that they are all running with the correct resources. Each virtual machine will have its own operating system with its bin/lib files. Although very functional, it can have a lot of strain on the physical machine because it has to allocate resources permanently. 
### Containers
A container is a form operating system virtualization where a software virtualizes all the necessary components to run a specific application on top of a host machines operating system. Like a virtual machine, it virtualizes all the necessary resources to run multiple isolated applications on a single host machine. Unlike the virtual machine where each machine has its own OS kernel and its binary and libraries allocated to each virtual machine, a container sits on top of a machines operating system and shares the same OS kernel, binaries and libraries as the host machine. This allows the container to be consider light weight and can deploy very quickly. The benefits of containers is that you can isolate applications and its required resources and make deployment extremely easy.
