This week I had an assignment due for my CIT424 information and System Security that really gave me a headache. My lab assignment was to hack into a server and deface a website. In order to do this, I had to install Metasploitable and Kali Linux on a virtual machine.

### What is Metasploitable
Metasploitable is a version linux that was designed to be more vulnerable so that it can be used as a means to practice penetration testing skills and test security tools. 
### What is Kali Linux
Kali Linux is Debian based linux operating system that is preloaded with a large amount of penetration testing and security auditing software. 
### What I did
I first had to install a virtual machine program. The program I used was called VirtualBox. I found the download here. 
-	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads
I also needed to download a Kali Linux and Metasploitable image here.

After installing virtualbox, I spun up a Metasploitable virtual machine. I set it up like this:
metasplotable
-	In virtual machine, I clicked New and entered a name for my VM which I called it META X. I changed it to Linux machine and Debian 32 bit.
-	I gave it 2 gigs of memory and 20 gigs of dynamic storage.
-	I went into settings > system checked enabled I/O APIC, unchecked Enable EFI
-	I went into settings > storage and mounted the metasploitable file.
Kali Linux
-	In virtual machine, clicked new and entered
