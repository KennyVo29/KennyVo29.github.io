<p>Setting up a Raspberry Pi and Connecting Remotely with SSH.</p>

<p>This is how you set up a Raspberry Pi for the first time and how you can connect to the Raspberry Pi using Secure Shell protocol.</p>
What is a Raspberry Pi?
A raspberry pi is a small computer about the size of a wallet or credit card. It is extremely cost efficient as it has all the necessary components to support a operating system. </p> 

<p>First, you would need to purchase a Raspberry Pi. I purchased a CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 - 4GB starter kit from CanaKit on Amazon. You can find it here --> https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-4GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B07V5JTMV9</p>
<p>It came with:</p>
    <li>-Raspberry Pi 4</li>
    <li>-Samsung Evo+ 32GB Micro SD Card</li>
   <li> -Case (mini tower)</li>
    <li>-Power Supply (on/off switch)</li>
    <li>-Micro HDMI to HDMI cable </li>
    <li>-Heat Sinks for components</li>
   <li> -Its running a 64-bit quad core processor @ 1.5 Ghz !!
