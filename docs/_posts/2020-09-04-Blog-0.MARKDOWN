# Setting up a Raspberry Pi and Connecting Remotely with SSH.

This is how you set up a Raspberry Pi for the first time and how you can connect to the Raspberry Pi using Secure Shell protocol.
What is a Raspberry Pi?
A raspberry pi is a small computer about the size of a wallet or credit card. It is extremely cost efficient as it has all the necessary components to support a operating system.  

First, you would need to purchase a Raspberry Pi. I purchased a CanaKit Raspberry Pi 4 - 4GB starter kit from CanaKit on Amazon. You can find it here --> https://www.amazon.com/CanaKit-Raspberry-4GB-Starter-Kit/dp/B07V5JTMV9
It came with:
-Raspberry Pi 4
-Samsung Evo+ 32GB Micro SD Card
-Case (mini tower)
-Power Supply (on/off switch)
-Micro HDMI to HDMI cable 
-Heat Sinks for components
-Its running a 64-bit quad core processor @ 1.5 Ghz !!
