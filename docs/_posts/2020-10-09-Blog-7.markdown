The presentation I did last week for my class was a success. 
 
I wrote a bit of text that I used for my part of the presentation.


iv.	Iâ€™ll start off by briefly introducing WEP and WPA.
b.	What is IEEE 802
i.	In order to understand where WEP and WPA came from, we must first learn a little about the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standard also known as IEEE 802.
ii.	IEEE 802 stands for Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer which is a family of standards that govern how devices interact at the bottom 2 layers of the OSI model. 
iii.	The IEEE 802 is a family of standards that govern the lower two layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection).
iv.	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
c.	What is WEP
i.	Security Algorithm for IEEE 802.11 Wireless networks that was at one point, the most widely used security method for networks.
ii.	 Released as a part of the original 802.11 standard which was ratified in 1997. 
iii.	It is known for its 64 bit (40-bit key | 5 character = 1 asci = 8 bits) or 128 bit modes (104-bit key | 13 characters = 1 asci = 8 bits). 
iv.	----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
d.	What is WPA 
i.	Wi-Fi Protected Access is a security protocol that provides wireless networks with security. The successor to WEP, it was created with the intention to fix all the weaknesses in WEP security algorithm. It was  announced in 2003 by the WIFI Alliance that WEP will be superseded by WPA. 
    Why is it important to have these protocols?
Its important to have confidentiality , integrity and availability. To obtain these three principles, we must protect our data using these security algorithms.
